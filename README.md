# branching-test

This is a dummy repository for testing git branching and release strategies.

* Created a `develop` branch for implementing new features.
* Add some more lines and made some changes.
* The latest commit shouldn't have been merged into master already.
* Created a release branch for version 1.0.
* Need to add a tiny fix for the 1.x branch

support 1.1
